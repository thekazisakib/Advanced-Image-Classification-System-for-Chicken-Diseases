## Data Description

The dataset consists of **images of chicken fecal samples** classified by disease type, allowing the model to identify specific diseases. The data is stored in `.dvc` format to manage versions and handle large datasets, which ensures easy reproducibility and consistency.

- **Image Data**: Chicken fecal images, covering various diseases.
- **Labels**: Annotated labels for each disease type.

## Solution Approach

### 1. Data Collection

- **Source**: Images were collected from available online resources and manually annotated.
- **Data Versioning**: Data Version Control (DVC) was used to manage data versions and ensure reproducibility.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Image Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling were applied to enrich the dataset and improve model robustness.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values were scaled for optimal model performance.

### 3. Model Architecture

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model was chosen due to its effectiveness in image classification tasks. Key layers include:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features through multiple layers of filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample the feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the features into disease categories.

The model architecture was carefully designed to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.

### 4. Model Training & Evaluation

The model was trained on the processed image data, with **92% accuracy** achieved. Evaluation metrics included:

- **Accuracy**: Measures overall model performance.
- **Precision & Recall**: Focus on identifying true disease cases correctly.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insights into classification accuracy for each disease type.

To improve accuracy, **hyperparameter tuning** was performed on parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.

## Business Impact

The project offers tangible business benefits for the poultry industry:

1. **Reduced Diagnostic Costs**: Automated disease detection cuts down costs associated with lab tests.
2. **Faster Diagnosis**: Instant results enable timely intervention, reducing disease spread and improving animal welfare.
3. **Improved Poultry Health**: Early diagnosis leads to better management of diseases, reducing mortality rates and enhancing production.
